## Exploration of the gapminder data set

This is a brief exploration of the gapminder dataset.
First, let's load the library:

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

##Summary of gapminder dataset:

```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```

##Let's select the variable year:

```{r}
select(gapminder, year)
```

##Now let's list country first and then list everything else:

```{r}
select(gapminder, country, everything())
```

##We'll arrange the dataset in descending order based on population:

```{r}
arrange(gapminder, desc(pop))
```

##Finally let's find all entries of Brazil and Germany occuring in the '80s:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter((country == "Brazil" | country == "Germany") & year >= 1980 & year < 1990 )

```
