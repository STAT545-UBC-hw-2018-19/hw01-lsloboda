## Exploration of the gapminder data set

This is a brief exploration of the gapminder dataset.

* First, let's load gapminder and tidyverse:

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

* We'll summarize gapminder dataset as a sanity check:

```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```

* Let's select the variable year:

```{r}
select(gapminder, year)
```

* We'll arrange the dataset in descending order based on population:

```{r}
arrange(gapminder, desc(pop))
```

* Let's find all entries of Brazil and Germany occuring in the '80s:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter((country == "Brazil" | country == "Germany") & year >= 1980 & year < 1990 )

```

* We'll plot the Year vs. Life Expectancy

```{r}
plot(x = gapminder$year, y = gapminder$lifeExp, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Life Expectancy')
```
