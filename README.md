# Laura's STAT 545 Homework 01 Repo

## Hello world!
Welcome to my homework 01 repository. Below, you will find a few facts about me!

## A little bit about me

I'm a *Master of Engineering* candidate studying Chemical and Biological Engineering. I was inspired to study engineering because my dream job as a child was to become an **astronaut**. 

I am originally from *Waterloo, Ontario*, where I completed a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering and a concurrent degree in Liberal Arts. 

After my undergraduate education, I worked full time for Toyota as a paint process engineer before moving to Vancouver. I worked at a fashion start-up in raw materials and innovation for a few years before returning to academia. 

My favourite past-time is martial arts, particularly **kung fu**.
